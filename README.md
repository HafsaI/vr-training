# Public Speaking Training in Virtual Reality

## About The Project

Our proposed solution is a virtual reality application for public speaking training. The virtual reality application will simulate a room and audience. The user can practice their speech in this application and the quality of the user's speech will be judged based on 3 different scores:

- Speech: The quality of the content and delivery style of the speaker,
- Body Posture: How was the speaker's body posture throughout the speech,
- Nervousness: How was the speaker's heart rate throughtout the speech.
